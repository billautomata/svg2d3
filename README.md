# svg2d3 [live demo](http://billautomata.github.io/svg2d3/)

Crawls an svg file and outputs the correct d3 code to render it.

Once you have the d3 code you can then make it interactive or incorporate the calls into your current application, letting you use complex resources without having to keep them in separate svg files.
